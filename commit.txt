feat: Integrate 'Saved Items' with backend API
 This commit resolves the final major inconsistency by migrating the 'Saved Items' feature from a
      localStorage-based implementation to a persistent, API-driven one.
 **API:** The backend API in `shop/api_views.py` and `urls.py` was enhanced to support fetching, adding, and
      securely deleting saved items.
 **Frontend Logic:** `lib/saved.ts` was refactored to use the new asynchronous API endpoints.
 **State Management:** A new `SavedItemsProvider` was created to manage the global state of saved items, fetchi
      data on load for authenticated users.
 **UI Integration:** The `app/saved/page.tsx` and `components/product-card.tsx` components were refactored to u
      the new `useSavedItems` hook, ensuring a reactive and consistent user experience. The provider was added to the
      root `layout.tsx`.
